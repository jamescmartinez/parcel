# Parcel: Package Sync for Atom

Parcel uses `~/.atom/packages.cson` to keep track of the packages that you have installed.

---

### Development
To work on Parcel symlink your local copy of Parcel to `~/.atom/packages/parcel`. This looks something like this:

``
ln -s ~/Development/parcel ~/.atom/packages/parcel
``
